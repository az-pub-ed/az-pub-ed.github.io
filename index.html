Consisting of educators, parents, and community leaders, we have gathered to address the dire state of public education in Arizona.

      <h2 data-i18n="demands_title" class="title">Our Demands</h2>
      <ol class="demands-list">
        <li data-i18n="">The state legislature must increase the Aggregate Expenditure Spending Limit in order to increase current school funding to functional levels.</li>
        <li>Increase the per student spending in the state of Arizona by $15,000, increasing to $25,000 in per pupil spending.</li>
        <li>Eliminate the voucher system that pulls money from public education funds, as the school choice movement has been historically created by “white flight” due to the re-integration of public schools.</li>
        <li>Increase teacher salaries by 30% so that we may recruit qualified, anti-bias, anti-racist teachers to the state of Arizona.</li>
        <li>Mandate that every public school employee is salaried and fully benefitted, from our classroom sweepers, to our food service workers, to our playground monitors. This will ensure that top quality candidates work with Arizona youth and will provide quality jobs in the community.</li>
        <li>Eliminate the use of standardized testing as a method of allocating funding, as this system has proven to be inequitable and harmful to public schools. </li>
        <li>End the two hour block for ESL students, as the “English Only” model of language instruction is a modern day form of segregation. </li>
        <li>Fund instruction and curriculum that centers the identities of our students and empowers them to be critical thinkers of the world around them, not conditioning our students to be compliant workers for massive corporations.</li>
      </ol>
